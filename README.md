# Experimental Project based on Minix3

This repository contains a fork of the minix3 operating system. The purpose of this project is to modify minix3 to experiment with ideas of unikernel and exokernel library operating systems. A Unikernel is an operating system kernel that is optimized to run one application thus minimizing the size of the operating system, removing multiprogramming system overhead, and increasing security. An exokernel is an operating system kernel that allows operating system applications more control over system resources by presenting application developers with improved access and control over physical machine resource abstractions. This project aims to combine ideas from both unikernels and exokernels in order to produce tiny, secure, operating systems that are highly optimized for a single application.
